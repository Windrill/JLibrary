how to run these tests independently?

Recommendations: Don't run tsc! It will produce js files that messes up all your module exports.


 vite ./JLibrary/tests/text_layer/

If jest keeps complaining about modules not found or imported, use:
   "jest": {
     "preset": "ts-jest"
   }
in package.json
