How to install: (need dependent node libraries!)
not sure if this is everything or excessive
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/dat.gui": "^0.7.7",
    "typescript": "^4.5.4",
    "vite": "^2.9.6"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/three": "^0.141.0",
    "dat.gui": "^0.7.9",
    "mathjs": "^10.6.1",
    "three": "^0.141.0"
  }
}
Note that it's mathjs not math.js

================================
How to import threejs properly:
import * as THREE from 'three'


Style
// D_ data structure (data only)
// R_ draw calls related (render)
C_ <-- my structures, mostly drawing material
C3_ <-- drawing material using THREE.JS
// files are lowercase, classes and functions, types are upper


Typescript Indexer (for convenience)
  [index: string]: any;

math.min.js:
separate math library that includes matrix expressions


// syn: testing syntax


How to clone locally:
git clone ~/JS/graphing/src/JLibrary/
git remote get-url --all origin

lol every repository will have write access, so just be aware
but seems like 'remote' which git stores a reference to is uniquely in the directory ~/JS/graphing/src/JLibrary/

 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (branch is currently checked out)

- it meant /home/windrill/JS/graphing/src/JLibrary was checkouted in branch master. Seems that they were able to tell. Not sure how bitbucket does it.
From source I checked out 'develop' branch (just temporary) and pushed again. Now it works
